A student decides to perform some operations on big words to compress them, so they become easy to remember. An
operation consists of choosing a group of K consecutive equal characters and removig them. The student keeps
performing this operation as long as it is possible. Determine the final word after the operation is performed.

**Example**
word = "abbcccb"
k=3

 - remove k = 3 characters 'c', now word = "abbb".
 - remove 3 characters 'b', so the final word is "a".
Hence, answer: "a"

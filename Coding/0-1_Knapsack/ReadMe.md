**Question:**

Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. 
In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items 
respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that 
sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or 
donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

**Example**

For `val[] = { 6, 10, 12 }`, `wt[] = { 2, 2, 3 }` and `W = 5`,

Answer should be `22`

**Solution approaches:**

I'll be solving it in three ways:
1. Recursive solution (Brute Force)
2. Recursive solution using Memoization (Top-down dynamic programming solution)
3. Iterative solution (Bottom-up dynamic programming solution)
